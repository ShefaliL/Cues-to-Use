# Cues-to-Use

It's fascinating to see what words a person remembers when given a certain term, since recalling
certain words gets progressively difficult as the context or scenario in which the person is in
changes. In this project,we aim to understand how a person remembers specific words based on cues to
other words in this project, as well as explore certain patterns in how a human memorizes and
correlates words with one another.
